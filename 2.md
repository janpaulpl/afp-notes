# Applicative, traversable, foldable

## Examples

### Transposing matrices

```hs
transpose :: [[a]] -> [[a]]
transpose [] -> repeat []
transpose (xs :: xss) = 
  zipWith (:) xs (transpose xss)
```

`zipWith` adds point-wise the list of `xss` to the corresponding transposed `xs`. 

```hs
zipWith :: (a -> b -> c) -> [a] -> [b] -> [c]

zipWith f[] [] = [] 

zipWith (x:xs) (y:ys) = f xy : z W f xs ys
```

This can be done with a combinator `zapp`

```hs
zapp : [a -> b] -> [a] -> [b]
```

## This is an applicative functor

```hs
class (Functor f) => Applicative f where
  pure :: a -> f a
  (<*>) :: f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
```

**Every monad can be given an applicative functor interface.**

```hs
instance Monad m => Applicative m where
  pure :: a -> m a
  pure = return
  mf <*> mx = do f <- mf; x <- mx; return (fx)
```

In the non-monadic instance, we need to make sure both lists are the same size.

The difference comes from:

```hs
(<*>) :: (Applicative f) =>
  f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b

(>>=) :: (Monad m) =>
  m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
```

- The monadic bind is inherently higher order.
- The applicative star is first order.
- With monads, subsequent actions can depend on the results of effects: depending on the character the user enters, respond differently.
- There are more `Applicative` functors than there are monads; but monads are more powerful!

```hs
miffy : Monad m => m Bool -> m a -> m a -> ma

miffy mc mt me =
  do b <- mc
  if b then mt else me

miffyApplicative = (\bt e -> if b then t else e) <$> 
  mc <*> mt <*> me
```

The `Applicative` has the same type signature `f Bool -> f a -> f a -> fa`

## Composing monads

If every monad is a functor, and we can compose functors, can we compose monads?

We can define:

```hs
data Compose m1 m2 a = Compose (m1 (m2 a))
instance (Monad m1, Monad m2) =>
  Monad (Compose m1 m2) where
    return :: a -> m1 (m2 a)
    (>>=) :: m1(m2 a) -> (a -> m1(m2 b)) -> m1(m2 b)
```

> Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that such an instance exists.

For any pair of applicative functors `f` and `g`:

```hs
data Compose f g a = Compose (f (g a))

instance (Applicative f, Applicative g) =>
  Applicative (Compose f g) where
    pure :: a -> f (g a)
    pure x = ...
    (<*>) :: f (f (a -> b)) -> (f (g a)) -> f (g b)
    fgf <*> fgx = (pure <*>) <*> fgf <*> fgx
```

We can define the desired `pure` and `<*>` operations, and there is a *guarantee of compositionality*!

## Imprecise but catchy slogans

> *Monads are programmable semi-colons!*
>
> *Applicatives are programmable function application!*

For monads:

```hs
x = c;
y = c';
```

For applicatives:

```hs
[mc mt me]
```

> There is an ambient notion of something being threaded.

## Applicative functor laws

- identity 

```hs
pure id <*> u = u
```

- compostion

```hs
pure (.) <*> u <*> v <*> w = u <*> (v <*> w)
```

- homomorphism

```hs
pure f <*> pure x = pure (f x)
```

- interchange

```hs
u <*> pure x = pure ( f -> fx) <*> u
```

## Folding

Think of `foldr` as a functional for loop.

### Folding beyond lists

```hs
data Tree a = Leaf a | Node (Tree a) (Tree a)
              | Empty

foldTree :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> Tree a -> b
foldTree f y Tempty     = y
foldTree f y (Leaf x)   = f x y
foldTree f y (Node l r) = 
  foldTree f (foldTree f y r) l 
```

> *Note that generic programming gives a slightly more precise account*,

### Foldable for `Maybe` 

```hs
instance Foldable Maybe where
  foldMap :: Monoid m => (a -> m) -> Maybe a -> m
  foldMap f Nothing = mempty
          f (Just x) = f x

instance Foldable (a, _) where
  foldMap :: Monoid m => (b -> m) -> (a, b) -> m
  foldMap f (x,y) = fy
```

### Surprising examples

```hs
minimum (1, 1000)
```

> returns `1000` because there's only one `b` value in the pair, as it only gets the minimum second pair.

```hs
lookup : Eq a => a -> [(a, b)] -> Maybe a

length (lookup 4 [(2, "Hello"), (4, "World"), (5, "!")])
```
> returns `1` because we are now getting the stirng in `a` which is just `1`.

**The price to pay for *very* overloaded and *very* generic functions!**

## Arrows

```hs
class Arrow a where
  arr :: (b -> c) -> a b c
  (>>>) :: a b c -> a c d -> a b d
  first :: a b c -> a (b, d) (c, d)
```
