# Type families and data kinds 

We've introduced `Equal` as a proof that two types are equal

```hs
data Equal a b where
  Refl :: Equal a a
```

We could even `prove` some properties of the relation for `refl`, `sym`, and `trans`.

We can also use equality proofs and phanton types are enough to `implement` GADTs

```hs
data Expr a 
  = LitI (Equal a Int) Int 
  = LitB (Equal a Bool) Bool
  ...
```

We can use GADTs to *reflect* types as data

```hs
data Type a where
  INT  :: Type Int
  BOOL :: Type Bool
  LIST :: Type a -> Type [a]
  PAIR :: Type a -> Type b -> Type (a, b) 
```

We can define dynamically typed valyes by packing up a type representation with a value

```hs
data Dynamic where
  Dyn :: Type a -> a -> Dynamic
```

## Generic programming

We can also define new functions *by induction on the type structure*

```hs
myShow :: TYpe a -> a -> String
myShow INT n      = showInt n
myShow BOOL True  = "True"
myShow BOOL False = "False"
myShow (Pair t1 t2) (a, b)
  = "(" ++ myShow t1 a ++ "," myShow t2 a ++ ")
```

## Problems with GADTs

```hs
toVec :: [a] -> Vec a
```

To define this function, we needed to reify natural numbers on the type level -- defining a singleton type `SNat`

```hs
vappend :: Vec a n -> Vec a m -> Vec a ??
```

We needed to construct an explicit relation describing how to add two types `n` and `m`

```data
data Sum m n s where
  SumZero ::              SumZero n n
  SumSucc :: Sum m n s -> Sum (Succ m n) (Succ s)
```

We've seen how to pass explicit evidence explaining how to add two 'type-level' natural numbers.

## Multi-parameter type classes

We can automate this trhough a *multi-parameter type class*

```hs
class Summable m n s | m n -> s where
  makeSum :: Sum m n s 

instance Summable Zero n n where
  makeSum = SumZero

instance Summable m n s => Summable (Succ m) n (Succ s) where
  makeSum = SumSucc makeSum

append :: Summable m n s => Vec a m -> Vec a n -> Vec a s
append = vappend makeSum
```

## Associated types and type families

Type classes let you capture an *interface* such as monads (supporting bind and return), or monoids (supporting an associative binary operator and identity element.)

These interfaces can describe *functions*, but what if we would like them to describe *types*?

### Associated types

*Associated types* let you declarea  type in a class declaration

```hs
class Collects c where
  type Elem c           -- Associate type synonym
  empty  :: c
  insert :: Elem c -> c -> c
  toList :: c -> [Elem c]
```

```hs
instance Eq e => Collects [e] where
  type Elem [e] = e
  ...

instance Collects IntSet where
  type Elem IntSet = Int
  ...
```

We can use such associated types to replace the functional dependencies we saw previously

```hs
class Summable m n where
  type TheSum m n
  makeSum :: Sum m n (TheSum m n)

instance Summable Zero n where
  type TheSum Zero n = n

instance Summable m n => Summable (Succ m) n where
  type TheSum (Succ m) n = Succ (TheSum m n)
```

#### Associate types or multi-parameter types?

Both approaches are similar in expressiveness. Multiparameter type classes with functional dependencies are no longer fashionable.

### Type families

Associated types always require a class definition---even if we're only interested in the types.

Type families build upon the technology that associated types provide, enabling you to write

```hs
type family Sum m n
type instance Sum Zero n     = n
type instance SUm (Succ m) n = Succ (Sum m n)
```

### Closed type families

If we piggyback on the associated type machinery, however, all our type families are *open*---we can add bogus definitions

```hs
type instance Sum n Zero = Zero
```

The more modern *closed type families* allow you to define a function between types using pattern matching

```hs
type family Sum n m where
  Sum Zero n     = n
  Sum (Succ n) n = Succ (Sum n m)
```

GHC will try to match a given type against the pattern one by one, taking the first branch that matches successfully.

## The need for more kinds

All our type level code is essentially untyped

```hs
type instance Sum Bool Int = Char
```

We want to "type-level types", as we have in the term-level. Because we've lifted functions to the type levels, we need to bound the signatures of these types (`*`) for function application.

```hs
data Zero
data Succ n

data Nat = Zero | Succ Nat
```

How can we ensure all numbers in our types to be build from `Zero` and `Succ`?

Using the `DataKings` language extension we can introduce new kinds and automatically *promote* data constructors into their type-level variants

```hs
{-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-}

data Nat = Zero | Succ Nat
```

This declaration introduces

- A new kind of `Nat`
- A type `Zero :: Nat`
- A type `Succ :: Nat -> Nat`

Previously, `Nat` was the type, and `Zero | Succ Nat` were data constructors. Now, `Nat` **becomes a kind** and `Zero | Succ Nat` **become type constructors**.

### Example

```hs
-- the usual definition of booleans
data Bool = True | False

-- 'not' function on values
not :: Bool -> Bool
not True = False
not False = True

-- 'not' function on types
type family Not (a :: Bool) :: Bool where 
  Not 'True  = 'False
  Not 'False = 'True
```

This says that `type family Not` is of **kind** `Bool -> Bool` (what would initially have been `* -> *`.) The `'` lets us talk about the promotion to talk about **type** `True` and `False`.

## List membership

`Member x xs` should be true if `x` is a member of the type-level list `xs`.

```hs
class Member x xs
instance Member x (x ': xs)
instance Member x xs => Member x (y ': xs)
instance TypeError ('Text "Not a member: " ':<>: 'ShowType x)
  => Member x '[]
```

Is this correct? 

```hs
instance {-# OVERLAPS #-}
         Member x {x ': xs}

instance {-# OVERLAPPABLE #-}
         Member x xs => Member x {y ': xs}
```

> Note: This is only for old Haskell, newer GHC doesn't require `Overlaps`

## Polymorphic kinds

Which is the kind of `Member`?

```hs
Member' :: *   -> [*] -> Bool
Member' :: Nat -> [Nat] -> Bool
```

Kinds may be *polymorphic* as types are.

```hs
Member' :: k -> [k] -> Bool
```

## Type-level application

```hs
data Apply f a = MkApply (f a)
```

What is the kind of `Apply`?

```hs
data Apply (f :: k -> *) (a :: k) = MkApply (f a)
```
