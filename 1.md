# Haskell review
> Haskell is a purely-functional language. Pure means no side-effects, you need a monad for it

```hs
map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
map f [] = []
map f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs
```

We can see pureness, polymorphism, and higher-order*ness* in play.
> Pattern matching on custom data types works as expected.

In Haskell, functions are *first class citizens*, therefore we can pass functions around and make higher-order functions possible. 

```hs
incrementList = map(\x -> x + 1)
checkList = map(\x -> x > 3)
```

> The `\` is for the input of a lambda function. 

The types for `incrementList` and `checkList` are concrete type functions for the original `map` type signature. 

## Interfaces
> Haskell classes define an *interface*

```hs
class Eq a where
    (==) :: a -> a -> Bool
```

Now we can define the instance for the type class 

```hs
instance Eq Bool where
    True == True   = True
    False == False = True
    _==_           = False
```

For actually using the classes, we can implement when an element occurs:

```hs
elem :: Eq a => a [a] -> Bool
elem :: []   => False
```

## Remark on quantifiers

If we have an example for `id` Haskell will do the following:

```hs
id :: a -> a
id x = y where
    y :: a
    y = x
```

Haskell will treat the original `a` as an `a_1` and the type signature for `y` as `a_2`. To fix this, we need a language extention `forall a. a -> a`, given from `ScopedTypeVars`. Default Haskell will do *lexically typed variables*.

### More `forall` extensions:

```hs
bar :: (forall a. a -> a) -> (Int, Bool)
bar = (id 1, id True)
```

If we instead define `forall a (a -> a)` Haskell won't compile because the caller can now define whatever `a` is needed, overwriting `id 1` to `id Unit` (for example if the caller does Unit instead of Int.)

### Another `forall` extension:
If we have `map :: forall b a (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]` then we can have the language extension `{-# LANGUAGE Type Applications #-}` and `map @ Bool (> 3)` changes the type order.

# Packages and modules

In Haskell, each file contains a separate *module*. Two reasons for modules:
- Units of separate compilation (not supported by all compilers.)
- Namespace management

## Syntax

```hs
module M(D(), f, g) where
import Data.List(unfoldr)
import qualified Data.Map as M
import Control.Monad hiding (mapM)
```

We start by specifying 
- The module name `M` 
- What we export `D(), f, g`, and the specific function uses
- Hide certain things if we want

Explanation for `D()`: for a `data D = A | B` we export type `D` and not the constructors. `D(A)` would pattern match constructor `A`. `D(..)` exports everything, but we usually want an abstraction to not inspect what pattern matches, so we can use functions outside of matching. 

This gives us:
- Hierarchal modules
- Export list
- Import list
- Qualified, unqualified

We can choose to not write `module` and Haskell will put in a `Main`. Each Haskell program **must have a `main :: IO()`**.

> All module names consist of at least one identifier starting with an uppercase letter, where each identifier is separated from the rest by a period. There are also no relative module names, it is absolute.

Some other rules:
- `import` declarations can only appear in the module header.
- A module can be imported multiple times in different ways.
- If a module is imported qualified, only the qualified names are brought into scope. 
- A module can be renamed using `as`. 
- Name clashes are reported lazily.
- Errors are also reported lazily.

Modules are allowed to be mutually recursive. **This is not supported well by GHC, and therefore somewhat discouraged**.
